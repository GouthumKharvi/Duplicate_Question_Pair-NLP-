# Duplicate_Question_Pair-NLP-
This project addresses the problem of identifying duplicate questions using NLP. It combines Bag of Words text vectorization with custom feature engineering to create a powerful feature set. A RandomForestClassifier is trained on these features to predict question duplication, with the model deployed via Streamlit on Heroku.
